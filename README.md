# The README
This is a README.md File. I'm probably sure you know what that does, and what it means. So let's get straight to it.

This is Nikechukwu Okoronkwo's official Github Page:
- Founder/Owner of NUGE
- Founder/Owner of the Pheasant Framework Group: Responsible for The Pheasant Framework.

Coding's pretty nice

<!-- I have used many languages, but my favourites have to be **C++** and **Dart**.
I have also worked on many fields, including but not limited to Web Development, Low-Level Systems Programming (as well as CLI Interfaces), Mobile Development (Flutter and iOS) as well as Embedded Systems. -->

You can email me using nikechukwu@nugegroup.com.
